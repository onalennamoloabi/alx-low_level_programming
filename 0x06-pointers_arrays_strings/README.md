In this project I will be tackling more tasks on pointers, arrays and strings. By the end of this task, I should know how to use pointers, arrays ands strings and what they are. I should also know the difference between an array and a string. I will be tackling the following tasks:
0. Write a function that concatenates two strings.
1. Same as above but it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes 
2. Write a function that copies a string that works exactly like strncpy
3. Write a function that compares two strings that works exactly like strncmp
4. Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
5.Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6. Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
7. Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.
