In this project I am learning about pointers, arrays and strings and how to use and manipulate them. The foolowing are all the tasks that will help me meet this learning objective:
- 0. 98 Battery st.: I write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
- 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream: I write the function that swaps the values of 2 integers.
- 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read - I write the function that returns the length of a string.
- 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them: I write a function that prints a new line following a string to the standard output.
- 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear - This function prints a string in reverse, foolowed by a new line.
- 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes: This function reverses a string.
- 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true: I write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
